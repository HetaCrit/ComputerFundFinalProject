# ComputerFundFinalProject
A UI friendly inventory management system. 

Java app that tracks store stock, simulates daily sales, and persists data between runs.

Identification:
Many small retailers still track inventory manually. This project automates stock tracking with simple CSV persistence and lets them simulate “what‑if” sales days for planning. It uses only standard‑library Java so it runs everywhere. Although my first iteration of this project had used the Swing utils in order to create a nice clean looking UI, codespaces unfortunatley does not allow package as it cannot render images through the terminal (of course). Should be a colored nice ui hopefully, as to me it is. 


## How to run
Open terminal
compile SRC folder: javac -d . src/*.java
Run the SRC/Main.java: - java -cp . src.Main
Enjoy!
